# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis using Scapy

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing network traffic captured using Wireshark. The captured packets are further processed using Python and the Scapy library to generate statistical insights and graphical visualizations.

The project demonstrates how different network protocols communicate and helps in understanding packet distribution, protocol hierarchy, and communication conversations between network hosts.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Capture live network traffic using Wireshark
- Generate protocol-based I/O graphs
- Recreate Wireshark graphs using Scapy and Python
- Analyze protocol hierarchy statistics
- Perform conversation-based network analysis

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- Wireshark
- Python
- Scapy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas (Optional)

---

## 📊 Features

### 1. I/O Graph Analysis
Graphs generated for:
- All Packets
- TCP Traffic
- UDP Traffic
- DNS Traffic
- HTTP/HTTPS Traffic
- TCP Error Analysis

---

### 2. Protocol Hierarchy Analysis
Extracts:
- Total number of packets
- Total packet size
- Payload size
- Header overhead

---

### 3. Conversation Analysis
Identifies:
- Unique communicating IP address pairs
- Pair transferring maximum bytes
- Average inter-packet time difference
- Protocol distribution per communication pair

---

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding packet-level network communication
- Visualization of network traffic behaviour
- Protocol efficiency and overhead analysis
- Network conversation tracking
